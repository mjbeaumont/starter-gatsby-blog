          The Hudson Valley Philharmonic began its existence as the Dutchess
          County Philharmonic Orchestra. The brainchild of four Poughkeepsie
          businessmen who also played classical music, the orchestra began in
          1932 as a small group of musicians who eventually gave their first
          public concert in 1934. One of the original businessmen, George
          Hagstrom, became the ensembleâ€™s first conductor, and the group
          consisted of professionals, amateurs, and student musicians from area
          high schools.
